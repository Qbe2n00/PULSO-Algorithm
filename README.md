## Method Overview
Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our ability to dissect complex biological processes by resolving cell-cell interactions at unprecedented resolution, existing computational frameworks often lose cell-level granularity through bulk aggregation and rely on gene-level inference that is vulnerable to high dropout rates. To overcome these limitations, we developed PULSO (Predictive Upstream Ligands using Single-cell transcriptOmics) — a computational framework that infers upstream ligand signaling activity at the single-cell level directly from transcriptomic profiles.

PULSO comprises two major components: ligand activity inference and cell–cell interaction analysis. In the ligand activity inference module, PULSO constructs a joint cell–gene co-embedding space and computes distances between individual cells and genes, treating these distances as gene importance scores at the single-cell level. These importance scores are then used to infer ligand activity between receiver cells of interest and their putative upstream ligand genes. Ligands predicted to show significantly elevated activity in the specific cell group of interest are selected as candidates. In the cell–cell interaction analysis module, PULSO uses these candidate ligands together with ligand–receptor databases to quantify interaction strength and identify sender cell populations that are predicted to regulate the receiver cells via these ligands.

## Ligand Activity Inference
PULSO refines ligand activity quantification by integrating [SIMBA](https://github.com/pinellolab/simba)-based cell–gene co-embedding with [NicheNet](https://github.com/saeyslab/nichenetr) to infer context-specific signaling based on embedding distances rather than raw gene expression values. After filtering ligand–target matrices to retain only expressed features, SIMBA co-embedding was performed with “sample” as a batch key, where gene expression was discretized into five k-means bins and cell–cell edges were constructed using Euclidean distance in a 30-dimensional HVG space. The resulting joint embeddings were used to compute normalized pairwise cell–gene distances, which replaced differential expression values as NicheNet inputs. Ligand activity per cell was estimated as the Pearson correlation between normalized distances and NicheNet regulatory potential scores, retaining only ligands with cognate receptor expression in target populations. Ligands with positive activity in at least 10 cells were selected for downstream analyses.

## Cell-Cell Interaction Analysis
To reconstruct cell–cell communication networks, PULSO incorporated significant ligand candidates into a [liana](https://github.com/saezlab/liana)-based interaction analysis using [OmniPath](https://omnipathdb.org/ligrec) ligand–receptor annotations. For each major cell type, ligands expressed in sender populations and receptors expressed in corresponding receiver subtypes were evaluated, with significance defined by geometric mean interaction scores at \(P < 0.01\). Network visualization was performed using normalized edge weights to represent cumulative ligand–receptor activity among condition-specific sender–receiver pairs.
